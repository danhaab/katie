After the production and printing of each annual **Austin Bat Cave** anthology, they would be distributed to the children writers that contributed. We'd then host a launch party--six that I organized--where the community would celebrate the children's work by listening to them read, selling the books, and mingling over an auction or free activities, food, and music: Party time!
