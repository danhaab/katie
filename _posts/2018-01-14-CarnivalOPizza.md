#### For five years, I was a point-person for a large-scale community carnival fundraiser, bringing together hundreds of community families to play dozens of carnival games and singular good times, all pizza-related and on-brand. I coordinated and recruited over 120 volunteers and worked with a stellar team of joyful professionals to raise a large portion of the annual budget for a local charity organization.
