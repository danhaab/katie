#### Living and working from the KAP Literary Center, Katherine Anne Porter's childhood home, as the Writer-in-Residence of Texas State University, I produced the Visiting Writers Series for three years, hosting author readings at two locations, craft talks, workshops, and book signings. From financial to contracts to publicity to event coordination, I directed over 30 writer visits and over 60 events total, organizing travel  and hospitality details, and more for writers such as George Saunders, Annie Proulx, Sandra Cisneros, Robert Stone, Tim O'Brien, Karen Russell, and more.
