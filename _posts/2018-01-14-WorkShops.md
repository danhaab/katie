For **Katherine Anne Porter Literary Center's** Visiting Writers Series and **Austin Bat Cave's** programming, I coordinated over 350 writing workshops for thousands of students, ages 6 and up. Whether it was managing an intimate workshop between a pulitzer-winning author and university students or an internationally-known pizza commentator and middle school kids, I've organized everything from curriculum to transportation.
