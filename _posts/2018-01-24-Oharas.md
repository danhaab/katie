Because **O'Hara's Landing** is a marina, we knew business relied on the weather. On the clean landing page that mirrors the brand's simplicity, we added an up-to-the-minute weather feature.

A complicated inventory of information begged for an visually-organized solution, a fun problem to solve.

 I interviewed owners and their family, compiling and editing information to create the content of this folksy timeline. The bygone ambiance of **O'Hara's Landing** provokes a storytelling atmosphere, which enticed us to incorporate it onto the modern platform.
