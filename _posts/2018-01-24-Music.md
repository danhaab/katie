Over the past 20 years, from production and promotion to hospitality to publicity to ticketing, I've worked concerts. Large-scale shows, multi-day festivals, intimate fundraisers, or SXSW showcases: I've done a little bit of everything.

Austin legend **Bill Callahan**, a long-time supporter of Austin Bat Cave, donated his talent for a fundraiser. I coordinated the intimate, yet sold-out event: promotion, publicity, PR, marketing, design, ticketing, and settling.

In my early twenties in Kansas, I learned about music through working in the music industry with several incredible women (and a few men).
