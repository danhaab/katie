For the **Austin Bat Cave** anthologies, stylish yet playful was the aesthetic. The important content--short stories about the zombie apocalypse, poems about ice cream, and essays about how difficult it is to be a teenager--was written by children. The rest of each project was finished by only a few plucky creatives, overseen by me from imagination to conception. Each child writer received a free copy for their bookshelves. Anthologies would be sold and distributed to volunteers, fans, funders, and supporters of Austin Bat Cave.

**Are you there, Godzilla? It's Me, Mothra**, an anthology for a popular writing organization, includes work by hundreds of underserved students. Like all of the anthologies, each student now owns a copy of the book. Poof! Published writers.

**Young Love** and **Dream It** were two anthologies where students wrote about two subjects in which they were each experts: Love and Dreams.
