**The Second Shelf** is a modern feminist rare books business, launched in London spring of 2018. In eight weeks working part time, I managed the business launch: established business systems, established and integrated platforms, its corresponding quarterly publication, wrote a business plan, and served as contacts for vendors, staff, and contributors. I coordinated branding across all platforms from print to social to websites to packaging to publications and managed the overall voice, organized communications and marketing, wrote copy for the publication, web content, publicity, social media, and newsletters.
