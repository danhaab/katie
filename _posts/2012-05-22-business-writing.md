#### In my previous position running a successful literary arts charity, I wrote, edited, and established standards for all of the associated material, including creating the overall voice for the organization. I wrote website content, grants, fundraising campaigns, blog posts, newsletters, press releases, events packages, author and artist bios, employee and board handbooks, social media strategy and day-to-day posts, long-term campaigns, front and end matter to all print books, copyedited hundreds of pages of book material, wrote video and advertising content, pamphlets, promotional material, and all front-facing media, while delegating tasks to staff and trustees as necessary. I would begin each project with strategy: outline content, establish deadline, and then pinpoint the audience and potential reach in order to most efficiently and effectively distribute the information. As a writer-in-residence for a university before my time with the charity, an appointed position awarded to one MFA graduate every 3-5 years, I wrote all events material from bios to interviews to official visit packets, as well as managing and writing a complete website overhaul hand-in-hand with the university. I did the same for the MFA programâ€™s webpage and the literary journal where I served as both Managing Editor and PR Editor during my time in graduate school. I've also written and published both fiction and nonfiction. Shaping language and communications has been my professional, personal, and educational focus for over 15 years.
