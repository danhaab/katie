For five years, I was a point-person for a large-scale community carnival fundraiser, bringing together hundreds of community families to play dozens of carnival games and singular good times, all pizza-related and on-brand. I coordinated and recruited over 120 volunteers and worked with a stellar team of joyful professionals to raise a large portion of the annual budget for a local charity organization.

Thousands of people came to the **Carnival O' Pizza** every year to play Coney Island type games, cheer on pizza eating contestants, and enjoy the chaos. All proceeds benefitted **Austin Bat Cave's** free writing programs for kids.

Build a carnival from scratch in a busy Austin parking lot, and the **Carnies** will come.

At the end of the night, crowds gather for the **Pizza Eating Competition** where grown people stuff disgusting amounts of pizza into their mouths.

Each year the carnival **themes** changed. Our team redesigned the entire carnival--hand-painted panels and publicity packets--around these playful themes.
