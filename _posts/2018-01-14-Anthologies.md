#### For the Austin Bat Cave anthologies, stylish and playful was a necessity. The important content--short stories about the zombie apocalypse, poems about ice cream, and essays about how difficult it is to be a teenager--was written by dozens of kids, but the rest of each project was finished by only a few plucky creatives. Each child contributor received a free copy for themselves, published authors.
