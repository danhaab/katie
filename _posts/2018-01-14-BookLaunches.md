After the production and printing of **Austin Bat Cave's** annual anthologies, they would be distributed to the children writers that contributed. We'd threw these kiddos book launch parties--six that I organized--where the community celebrated the children's work. We'd listen to them read, distribute the books, and mingle over auctions, activities, food, drinks, and music. Party time!

 Educating people about **Austin Bat Cave** was a big part of each event, especially when highlighting our most proud projects--the anthologies of student writing.

The highlight of each anthology launch were the student readings. They would recite or read their work to an audience of peers, community members, and families.
